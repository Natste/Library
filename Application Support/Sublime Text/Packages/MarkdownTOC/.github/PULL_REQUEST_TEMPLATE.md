<!--
You should use unit-tests for SublimeText by using [UnitTesting](https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting) plugin.

1. Install the UnitTesting plugin
2. Comment out or rename your own `MarkdownTOC.sublime-settings` so individual settings are not used during testing
3. [Run tests](https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting-example#running-tests)
4. Send Pull Request when tests pass
