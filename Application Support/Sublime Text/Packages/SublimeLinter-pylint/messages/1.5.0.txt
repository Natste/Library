SublimeLinter-pylint 1.5.0
--------------------------

Pylint now only runs on the actual files, i.e. on load and on save.

This ensures it runs in a context where imports are available etc. Previously,
it would try to switch behaviour on the fly, which would result in different
errors depending on how pylint was run.
