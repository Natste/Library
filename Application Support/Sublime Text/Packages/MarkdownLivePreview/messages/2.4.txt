Sorry to interrupt you... :(

Some stuff changed on MarkdownLivePreview. It now supports YAML/TOML front matters. You can hide it,
or show it in a pre block (edit your settings for this).

Hope you'll enjoy it!

Tip of the day: If you want a VIM-like search feature, then just press 'ctrl/cmd+i'
                (Find â†’ Incremental find). You can still go the next match by pressing 'f3', and to
                the previous one by pressing 'shift+f3'
