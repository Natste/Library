Sorry to interrupt you... :(

Something changed on MarkdownLivePreview: the preview is now scrolled to where
you are editing your markdown file! It doesn't scroll back up all the time any
more!

Tip of the day: You can center the screen on your cursor by pressing:
               `ctrl+k, ctrl+v` (on OSX `cmd+k, cmd+v`)
