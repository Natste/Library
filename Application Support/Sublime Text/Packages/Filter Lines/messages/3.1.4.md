#3.1.4  August 8, 2019

This release is for Sublime Text 3 users. I have separate versions of the plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3, and the version for Sublime Text 2 remains unchanged for now.

##Changes

- Merged fold.py into filter.py as suggested by FichteFoll to resolve issue #53, which sometimes caused Filter Lines menu items to appear disabled in ST 3.
