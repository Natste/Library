v3.0.0-alpha.5 (2017-03-29)
---------------------------

Welcome to the PackageDev pre-release channel (currently in alpha)!

Following the addition of syntax highlighting for sublime-syntax files in the
past releases, this release brings a couple new features.

Big shout-out to @kingkeith, who did the initial work for these.

+ Entirely new syntax definitions for:
  
  * sublime-snippets
  * tmPreferences
  * Property Lists in general (relevant for tmTheme)
  * sublime-keymap

  Especially keymaps have a very detailed highlighting now with better
  completions, highlighting of scope selectors and snippet contents to the
  `insert_snippet` command.

+ Auto-completions for syntax tests.

  Hitting `tab` on a syntax test line (usually indicated by a comment line)
  will automatically add a test for the first character that was not tested in
  a previous test line. Inserting `<-` will test the first character of the
  line.
  
  Inserting `^` on an otherwise empty test line will automatically insert a
  test for the character at the indicated position. Inserting more `^`  will
  extend the test to the following characters and automatically compute the
  common scopes for these.
  
  Additionally, the characters that are tested with the current test line are
  highlighted by an outline (configurable).

* All syntax definitions have been moved or renamed within the Package. As a
  result, you will most likely notice error messages from Sublime Text
  reporting missing files. Just close and re-open files that this package
  provides syntax highlighting for.
  
* Other minor changes (there are many commits in this release).
